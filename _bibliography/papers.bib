  abstract = {Deep Neural Network representations correlate very well with neural responses measured in primatesâ€™ brains and with psychological representations of human similarity judgement tasks, making them possible models for human behavior-related tasks. This study investigates whether DNNs can learn an implicit association (between colors and emotions) for images. An experiment was conducted in which subjects were asked to select a color for a given emotion-inducing image. These human responses (decision probabilities) were modeled on neural networks using representations extractedfrom pre-trained DNNs for the images and colors (a square of the color). The model presented showed a fuzzy linear relationship with the decision probabilities. Finally, this model was presented as a model for emotion classification tasks, specifically with very few training examples, showing an improvement in accuracy from a standard classification model. This analysis can be of relevance to psychologists studying these associations and AI researchers modelling emotional intelligence in machines.},

  abstract = {A system includes a representation generator subsystem configured to execute a user representation model and a task prediction model to generate a user representation for a user. The user representation model receives user event sequence data comprises a sequence of user interactions with the system. The task prediction model is configured to train the user representation model. The user representation includes a vector of a predetermined size that represents the user event sequence data and is generated by applying the trained user representation model to the user event sequence data. A storage requirement of the user representation is less than a storage space requirement of the user event sequence data. The system includes a data store configured for storing the user representation in a user profile associated with the user.},
