- Developed an HTML experiment for data collection on color selection for emotion-inducing images, demonstrating a significant emotion-color association in humans with a correlation of 0.34 in pre-trained classification models
- Co-authored a paper “Emotion-Color Association in Biologically Inspired Deep Neural Networks” (Gupta, S., & Gupta, S. 2021), published in the Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, 43rd edition
