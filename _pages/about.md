Hi! I am Shivi, a grad student doing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University graduating in May 2025. Previously I've finished my undergrad in Electrical Engineering (and Physics) at IIT Kanpur. I work on AI/ML, Parallel Programming, Systems Optimization, and Neuromorphic Computing. I also have a strong foundational background working with ML algorithms in Vision, Multimodal, Language Models, and Time-Series data.

Apart from that, I'm a huge coffee enthusiast (and I can definitely taste fruity notes in Arabica Coffee, I swear.) I also love dabbling in music, occasionally playing my ukulele, piano, and sometimes guitar. And I also experiment with cooking whenever I get some time.
